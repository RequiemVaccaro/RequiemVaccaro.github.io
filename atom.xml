<hr>
<p>We recently sat down with Wunderhorse lead singer, songwriter and guitarist Jacob Slater to discuss the alternative rock band’s rise and the release of what we’re naming the frontrunner for album of the year.</p>
<p>Nope, not exaggerating – it really is that good.</p>
<p>As one of the most exciting lyricists and all-round talents, not to mention the frontman for arguably one of the best new bands around right now, Jacob Slater is amassing a fiercely passionate following of loyal fans who are lapping every second, from the quietly released solo project to cult favourite live clips.</p>
<p>He also happens to have helped co-write and create one of the biggest middle fingers to so-called ‘sophomore syndrome’ there’s been in years, as  Wunderhorse’s second record Midas  has genuinely been on repeat in the office non-stop since release – safe to say we had a lot to say in this interview.</p>

<h2 id="interview-jacob-slater-on-wunderhorse-gaining-serious-traction"><strong>Interview | Jacob Slater on Wunderhorse gaining serious traction</strong></h2>
<p><strong>So what’s it been like watching this thing become as big as it has of late?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve all been in various projects over the last decade or so that have, kind of, maybe gone somewhere, but not kind of like properly taken off to the point where we were satisfied with, and I think this is the first time we’ve all been in something that’s really starting to work.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it’s been sort of 10 years plus in the making and so, yeah, it feels good.</p>
<p><strong>We first saw you supporting Sam Fender at Castlefield Bowl and the crowd was already there – do you have any standout memories from that gig?</strong></p>
<p>Manchester’s always just been very good to us. It usually sells out; it’s one of the first ones on the tours to kind of sell out and people always seem really up for it.</p>
<p>I think from that  Sam  show it was just that it was a big step up for us. I think that was the day after we did those two gigs with Fontaines [D.C.] at Ivy Gardens, but prior to that weekend, you know, we hadn’t done anything quite like that.</p>
<p>We’d been playing, you know, 200-250 cap venues max, so to go from that to thousands of people was, you know, it’s quite a shock but it weirdly felt right. It was like, ‘Yeah, this is what we want to be doing’, you know?</p>
<p><strong>For sure, and you’ve just mentioned Fontaines there, who also have new music out and you’ve spoken before about them bringing guitar-driven music back to the forefront. How does it feel to be helping spearhead that revival?</strong></p>
<p>It feels good, man. We’ve been lucky enough to play with them a few times and they’re definitely very good at what they do, and it’s nice to see so many people connecting with that kind of music again. And, yeah, if we’re included in that, then all the better.</p>
<p><strong>Now onto Midas itself, we have our own favourites already but do you guys have a particular standout that you’re most excited for people to hear live?</strong></p>
<p>It’s interesting really – I think the one that wasn’t actually going to be a single.</p>
<p>You know, these days you think you’re going to do three singles and you end up doing 10, because you know the general population has the attention span of a goldfish, but it’s like you have to kind of try and keep people engaged or whatever. I don’t know why. If it was up to me, we’d release a lot less.</p>
<p>But yeah, one that wasn’t supposed to be released as a single was ‘Rain’, but actually I realised it’s one of my favourite moments on the record. I probably would have still saved it for the album, but now it’s out, yeah, I like that one.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, that’s a really addictive song. I’d say it has a lot of the qualities people love about you guys in that it’s very straight to the point – maybe a bit more aggressive. It’s almost like the attitude comes first and the melody comes second this time, is that how you see it?</strong></p>
<p>I think it’s just more of an accurate representation of who we are. The  Cub  [debut album] stuff, those songs some of them were written when I was a teenager and I was still finding my way in and trying to find my feet in terms of how I felt comfortable writing.</p>
<p>I think Midas is arriving at that point with a band around us and going okay, this is who we are and I’m confident in that, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Did it come out of more of experimentation, that you sort of like got back to that? Like, was there a sound you were going for or just whatever came out in the studio?</strong></p>
<p>No, I mean we came into the studio with all these ideas, most of which just fell by the wayside, like we didn’t actually work them out, which is quite scary.</p>
<p>We were over in America, the label spent a load of money and we didn’t know what we were going to do, but once we got  ‘Midas’  the actual title track together, everything sort of fell into place and we ended up just writing most of the record out there in the studio.</p>
<p>It was that old cliche about capturing lightning in a bottle; there was something in the air that allowed us to create this world very, very quickly, so yeah, yeah, it’s just a product of that really.</p>
<p>I think it’s everyone’s input as well, i.e. you’re hearing songs as they’re coming into being rather than after they’ve been learned and played live and kind of levelled out.</p>
<p>You’re still hearing them, with all their errors in, and I think that’s a really magic place for songs to live and they’re only there very briefly, so I feel very lucky that we managed to capture them at that point, because most of the time you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>Love that. There’s also plenty of breadth to the sound as well, from grunge to shoegaze and then more indie roots. I know you’ve mentioned a lot of your influences in the past but what sort of stuff were you listening to when making Midas?</strong></p>
<p>I mean, I’ve always listened to grunge – that was always a big thing, especially for me and Harry [Fowler, lead guitarist] growing up. I met Harry when I was like 14 or something and that’s what we bonded over, you know, that 90s sound, so it’s always been there.</p>
<p>And you know I’ve always loved sort of the older, heavier sort of stuff from the early  punk  days in the US like The Stooges, they’re one of my favourite bands of all time, so it’s always kind of been there it’s just that on Cub I wasn’t really exploring that.</p>
<p>I wanted to, I just couldn’t get the sound right for it, but this time it’s like, okay, this is more like bringing that into the picture and I feel like it was missing before and now it’s well represented in Wunderhorse.</p>
<p><strong>For sure, I mean you’re very much considered part of this modern post-punk movement – do you feel assigned to that at all or is it just you play whatever you like?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we just make whatever music we feel like at the time. Yeah, the whole post-punk thing: I always get confused with the labels. You know, there’s people who sort of can fit everything into all these little tiny little pigeon holes and I get lost with all the posts and pres. I just like what I like really.</p>
<p><strong>The best way to be. What about the contemporary then, who are you listening to at the minute?</strong></p>
<p>There’s an artist called  Wu-Lu  from south London headed up by a guy called Miles, I’m always interested to see what they’re going to do next.</p>
<p>There’s a band called Sorry as well who are heading out on tour with  Fontaines  and, yeah, I like bands that you know sort of unpredictable and I just don’t know what they’re going to do next but honestly, I’m a bit of a hermit in that a lot of my music taste is kind like I’m a bit of an old man.</p>
<p>I sort of like live under a rock a bit; It’s great when people show me new stuff, I’m just not that active and kind of going out and and looking for it. If I come across it then great but you know, it usually takes somebody who’s a bit more in the know to give me a nudge and say, oh, have you heard this?</p>
<p><strong>That’s fair haha. Well, going back to old stuff, with the news that one of your favourites, the Sex Pistols, going back out on tour with Frank Carter, if you could front for one band’s reunion who would it be?</strong></p>
<p>Oh I dunno, I don’t think I’d do it with any. I think if it was a band I really liked I’d be sort of quaking in my boots trying to. There’s plenty of bands I’d want to bring back, though.</p>
<p>I’d love to have, you know, seen The Clash around 1979. That would’ve been great as London Calling was kind of coming together, and The Stooges back in the day, around ’69-70, would have been off the chart as well.</p>
<p><strong>Absolutely, and speaking gigs, how excited are you to head out on tour and how do you think the live experience is going to differ from previous shows now, if at all?</strong></p>
<p>I think it’s just that the songs are really, really simple and they all just go pretty hard for the most part. There are a couple of slow ones on the record, but they’re just a great vehicle for just thrashing sh*t out.</p>
<p>I think that’s really what we wanted to do with this album as well: make something super simple, just really simple, good songs, and I think that we’ve done that. It makes it very easy to just take it out, play it live, just have some fun and not be too precious about them.</p>
<p>These songs don’t want you to be precious, they don’t want to be handled with care, so that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>That works for us and yeah, I mean you’re known for a fair few antics and being pretty raw on stage, from sticking your fingers down your throat to jumping in the crowd and pretending you’re in the front row. Where does that energy come from, or is it whatever feels right in the moment?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I never plan anything I do. I feel like sometimes you can catch yourself and find you’re almost about to do something because it worked last time. You have to stop that immediately because then it becomes a performance, it becomes this like a rehearsed thing.</p>
<p>You’re just kidding yourself and you’re kidding the audience, it’s not a good way to be, I don’t think – well for us anyway. I think a lot of that stuff just comes from being cooped up in a tour bus all day, you know.</p>
<p>You’re naturally someone who’s got quite a few things going on in your head, then you’re offered this stage and loads of people you’re, so it’s a good place to sort of bring those things into like tangible reality however you want.</p>
<p>Honestly, it sounds like a sort of cliched kind of thing to say but, actually, the stage is that time where I can really be myself and do all the things that I want to do the rest of the day – but you usually can’t, because then, you know, you wouldn’t get invited around for Christmas anymore [he grins].</p>
<p>There are so many things that I think a lot of people feel and want to do and you can’t, but on the stage for that hour, what we say goes and what a rare opportunity to actually just do whatever you want, so yeah yeah, like you say, it’s not contrived if it’s your domain and it feels right in the moment.</p>
<p><strong>And lastly, it would be daft not to ask you about any Northern bands you’ve admired coming up?</strong></p>
<p>Stone Roses , they were a massive influence. I think you just hit a period in your mid-teens where suddenly The Stone Roses just make so much sense. I mean, those Manchester bands are so well documented, I’m sure I’d just be saying the same as everyone else, but obviously, The Smiths and Joy Division, Happy Mondays.</p>
<p>For the most part, I mainly listen to American artists – I always find myself going back to American or Canadian songwriters, you know, Leonard Cohen, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, but bands and people definitely seem to be quite drawn to that area of the country.</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s also exciting getting an interview with an up-and-coming band but to get time with an artists like Jacob Slater and an outfit growing as fast as Wunderhorse, who might genuinely have just put out album of the year is a privilege – and if you haven’t started listening to them yet, we advise you fix that now.</p>

<hr>
<p>The name Jacob Slater may ring bells with some music fans, as he was the frontman of the very popular punk outfit the Dead Pretties. The band were hugely successful around the South London area and beyond but the project burnt out and Jacob found himself washed on the shores of Cornwall. It was here he embraced his love for surfing and the more relaxed lifestyle this county has to offer, however, it wasn’t long before new music came flowing through him. Fast forward a few years an Wunderhorse has released their debut album ‘Cub’, and played a sell-out show in London’s The Lafayette.</p>
<p>With all this in mind we were eager to chat to Jacob to pinch his ear about his love for Cornwall, life after London, new music and much more!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Kieran: Thanks so much for having a chat with us, how are things going?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> Things are going well thanks, thank you for making the time.</p>
<p><strong>Kieran: So, ‘Cub’ has been out in the wild for a bit now, how does it feel and what’s the response been like so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> The response has been really positive, which I’m happy about because you never know how these things that have been sat in your brain for so long are going to be received by the wider world.</p>
<p><strong>Kieran: The album had been eight years in the making so I am curious to know when you knew the right time to release it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> We were going to release a while back, but COVID put a stop to that. We got into the studio in Rockfield as soon as we could; we just wanted to get it out as soon as possible without necessarily waiting for the right time, just ASAP.</p>
<p><strong>Kieran: There is an obvious clear distinction between what you’re doing with Wunderhorse in comparison to the Dead Pretties, but is there anything you feel has crossed the border into the music you’re creating now?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> There’s some overlap. Songs like ‘Leader of the Pack’ were written toward the end of Dead Pretties, but never really found a place in the Dead Pretties repertoire or in the live set: Wunderhorse was a better home for that. We definitely carried over some of the live energy from those shows and the work ethic – that’s one think that DP taught me, graft.</p>
<p><strong>Kieran: After the Dead Pretties came to an end what was it that drew you to Cornwall?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> I’ve been coming to Cornwall since I was about nine years old – surfing and stuff – I’ve always loved it, it’s always felt like home more than anywhere else in the world. So it made it very happy to be able to finally call it home properly, it’s a good place for me to create, be quiet and just be who I am… I feel like the most genuine version of myself when I’m down here.</p>
<p><strong>Kieran: How has your experience been so far and did you surf before arriving on our golden shores?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> I’ve been surfing since I was about nine years, but I’ve done it more and more since I’ve been down here. Maximising my time in the water was another reason for me moving down here; along with music, surfing is my true love really.</p>
<p><strong>Kieran: What was it that drew you towards surfing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> You get a feeling from it that you don’t really get from anything else in the world. It’s an are of my life where I have the freedom to fail and I don’t put too much pressure on myself to be the best: it’s just something I do for the pure love of it without any specific end goal, and I feel like everyone should have something like that in their life.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://requiemvaccaro.github.io/post-images/1759935555792.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p><strong>Kieran: Did Cornwall influence your writing or creativity in any way?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> Yeah certainly, I think it’s really helped being out of London. Some people are suited to that kind of city environment, but I feel like I need to be able to see the horizon and be around people who don’t necessarily think about music in the same way that the London scene does. Music is a big part of people’s lives down here, but it isn’t necessarily the be-all and end-all and they’re not obsessed with what’s cool and what isn’t – which gives you the freedom and space of mind to be able to develop your own things without too much negative  outside influence.</p>
<p><strong>Kieran: Do you still like playing in London and is there anything you miss?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> I like going back to play the odd show, but I don’t really miss London. It’s nice to catch up with old friends and stuff, but it’s definitely not for me.</p>
<p><strong>Kieran: You’re heading on a UK headline tour next year, are there any spots, in particular, you’re looking forward to playing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> Glasgow and Newquay. Andy (our booking agent) was wise enough to get us some gigs down here. I think it’s important to play to what is essentially our home crowd, I don’t think that many people down here know about Wunderhorse yet, but I wanna change that; I’m proud to be from Newquay and I want to share that with everyone. Everyone down here has indirectly influenced me in some way, and I want everyone to be a part of it. And Glasgow is always a laugh, it’s the best major city in the UK to play.</p>
<p><strong>Kieran: What can we expect from a Wunderhorse live show?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> We give 100%. alongside the other guys in the band, Jamie, Harry and Pete – we aim to leave our bodies on the stage after the set. We want people to leave feeling fulfilled; like they’ve witnessed something that is unique and different every night.</p>
<p><strong>Kieran: What are your five essentials for a tour?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> Instruments. Not getting sick. Boxing gloves: me and Harry, the guitarist (we’ve have been friends since we were like fourteen) want to keep fit in some way and it’s good to smack the shit out of each other a bit to keep the blood pumping before shows and not get too bored. Decent hotel bookings is another essential: they don’t have to be ‘decent’ hotels, but they need to be booked properly. There’ve been too many occasions in the past where you turn up, our room’s been booked for the wrong month and you have to sleep in the van – which is pretty gnarly in the winter. Final essential is keeping an eye on everyone in the band: keeping the social equilibrium and making sure everyone’s happy.</p>
<p><strong>Kieran: Lastly, what’s in store for Wunderhorse for 2023 and beyond?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob:</strong> More music. 2023 is going to be a big year for us for live shows too, we have the Pixies tour, our headline tour, and perhaps we’ll head back to America. Then – if we have enough beans left in us – we’ll record the next album.</p>

<hr>
<p>The band’s debut record, 2022’s, Cub, was gritty and honest, brimming with reflections on heartache, self-exploration, and the strain of youth: relatable in ways you might wish it wasn’t. Their set in New York City last Saturday night satiated a hungry crowd, stitching together the old and the new with snaking guitar licks, electrifying vocals, and magnetic bass lines, the drums acting as the backbone to a sizzling body of sound. Wunderhorse met us where we were with rich and addictive melodies as intimate and compulsory as the lyrics. Towards the end of the set, Slater asked the crowd what they wanted to hear, and for at least a minute, the room shouted their track requests with a desperate conviction, as though they might never hear it again. The excitement was tangible, and I was surprised by how vicariously proud I felt. It was a night of punk with purpose, introspection and intensity: a shimmering display of sonic versatility with energy to spare.</p>
<p>Shortly after the set, I wrote in my notes to remember to write that they were “epic” and “unforgettable.” Wunderhorse was epic and unforgettable. On the horizon are their biggest shows yet and the release of their second record. They’re on their way.</p>
<p><strong>So I saw you guys here last year at Mercury Lounge, how does it feel to be back in New York?</strong></p>
<p>Jacob: Feels great!</p>
<p>Pete: Feels like we never left!</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, welcome back! Cub has been out for a while, and you’ve played it quite a bit since then. Do you feel like the album has taken on a new meaning?</strong></p>
<p>Jacob: Yeah, it turns a year old in October. I think we all feel as a group that we’ve left it behind quite quickly, because there’s been a really long build up to writing and recording and releasing. We knew the songs so well by the time it came out. We’ve just recently done our next record, and those are the songs we’re really excited about now. We’re still playing some of the Cub stuff, but musically I feel like we’ve moved on from it.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, I hear that. Cub felt really introspective in a lot of ways, listening to it felt like a cathartic release. How has the transition been? I’m wondering if any of those same feelings are present in what you’re writing now?</strong></p>
<p>Jacob: Yeah, we’re writing as a band a lot more now, rather than just me, which is kind of what Cub was. There’s a lot more of all of our personalities in the new one, it’s a lot more collaborative. And the subject matter is very different. A lot of the songs on Cub are really, really old, and it was cathartic in the sense that they had to come out, on a personal level.</p>
<p>Pete: The new album represents more of a moment in time for us. A lot of the songs that are going to end up being on the record are collaboratively written, we came with an idea of what songs we thought we were going to have.</p>
<p>Harry: Yeah, we came in kind of half prepared and a little bit concerned whether anything was going to actually come out.</p>
<p>Jacob: A little bit, yeah</p>
<p>Harry: We kind of had a vague idea what we wanted it to sound like, but we were kind of guided by Craig Silvey, who was a massive part of that process, and if it wasn’t for Craig, half of it wouldn’t be what it is.</p>
<p>Jacob: Half of that record was written in the studio, and Craig created an environment that was totally new to us.</p>
<p>Harry: Yeah, we weren’t crazy rehearsing the new songs, there’s one song called Midas on there and we used a tape that was a rehearsal of the song. We weren’t planning on it being the tape but it ended up being the tape. So yeah, there’s a lot more character on the next album.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://requiemvaccaro.github.io/post-images/1759931659500.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p><strong>Funny how that happens. You mentioned working with Craig in a new environment, what did that look like?</strong></p>
<p>Pete: Well we’d never actually written in a studio before. Prior to that, it had always very much been Jacob coming in with an idea and us trying to figure it out with him in a rehearsal room or someone’s bedroom. But being in a studio with a full setup, being able to play something and have it played back to us makes you start to listen to music very differently. You start to process it very differently.</p>
<p><strong>Within the vein of processing and experiencing music, I saw on your Instagram that you recently played a show that had a notably incredible crowd.</strong></p>
<p>All: Toronto!</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, that was it. What about that show or that crowd was so special?</strong></p>
<p>Jacob: Well I was tripping quite hard. But I think it was just one of those shows where everything just comes together. I remember asking the guys, ‘Was that as good as I thought it was?’ and everyone answering, ‘Yeah, that was really good!’ It’s a weird, alchemic thing, and you can’t really put your finger on what it is, but everyone is just in exactly the right headspace to collaborate and come together and create something that’s bigger than just the running order of the songs. Some nights, it’s more like a job, you just go on and play the songs, but some nights you really lose yourself in it, and I think we really did that at that show. I think we got a good feeling for the place too. We got there and were like, Yeah this is a really cool place. And it created a nice mood for the rest of the day and resulted in a great show.</p>
<p>Pete: On top of that as well, at the start of this short stint, we were playing new songs fresh out of the studio onstage, and I think it always takes a couple of days to warm up to it and learn how it works live and start relaxing into it, letting it do its thing. I think [Toronto] was the third or fourth show, and we felt like it really belonged.</p>
<p><img src="https://requiemvaccaro.github.io/post-images/1759931700787.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
<img src="https://requiemvaccaro.github.io/post-images/1759931712908.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><strong>And right before that, you were on tour with Fontaines DC, how was that?</strong></p>
<p>Jacob: Great. Really good opportunity to watch people who are so good at their craft and have been on the road more and really know what they’re doing. We learned a great deal from them.</p>
<p><strong>And I assume working with them was motivating creatively.</strong></p>
<p>Harry: Yeah, there are certainly a couple songs on the new record that wouldn’t be there without them, the inspiration we got from them, being on the road with them, watching them more or less every night. It definitely rubbed off on us.</p>
<p>Jamie: And it really gave us a leg up. We were in no position to support them at the time, like whatsoever. And then we did it from two months here and in the UK, and I think the ground rose a little bit underneath us. No one in the industry was giving us really any recognition, and it felt really natural and authentic for a band we all look up to to be like, Hey, come on the road with us. That kind of started generating a bit of momentum for us.</p>
<p>Harry: It’s definitely given us the attitude of when we look at bands to support us, to make sure that we always pick a band that we genuinely feel like needs the opportunity that Fontaines gave us. They’ve done a lot for us.</p>

<p><strong>All that touring can be so exhausting, what do you guys do to wind down, on tour or back home?</strong></p>
<p>Jacob: Go surfing.</p>
<p><strong>I surf! Well, I can surf.</strong></p>
<p>Jacob: Really, nice! That’s the absolute best thing for me to do personally.</p>
<p><strong>It’s very therapeutic.</strong></p>
<p>Harry: I lay in a dark room for days on end.</p>
<p>Jamie: I do other music projects, football, sports, that kind of thing. The pub.</p>
<p>All: The pub!</p>
<p><img src="https://requiemvaccaro.github.io/post-images/1759931842531.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>

<img src="https://requiemvaccaro.github.io/post-images/1759931879569.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><strong>Yeah, that’s all of us.</strong></p>
<p>Pete: I just like getting outside where there’s no people. Being somewhere on a walk or something like that, you’re in cities constantly, you’re around people constantly, it’s nice to get outside, not specifically in nature but just somewhere where you won’t see anyone. Where you can be alone with your thoughts.</p>
<p>Jacob: Lack of people, basically.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, silence must be nice.</strong></p>
<p>Pete: Yeah, a place to recharge your social battery.</p>
<p><strong>What are you guys listening to right now?</strong></p>
<p>Harry: When we were recording, we were listening a lot to Exile on Main St. We listened to a lot of Dylan. Those are the two that jump out.</p>
<p>Jamie: Yeah, Jonestown Massacre</p>
<p>Pete: The Replacements</p>
<p>Jacob: Grian from Fontaines just put out a record, well not a record but he’s got some singles that I’ve been really enjoying. I’m quite out of the loop honestly, I don’t know what’s happening much, so I just listen to old stuff! But every once in a while something comes along. I don’t know if they’ve got anything out, but a band supported us in Toronto actually, they were so much fun.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="3"><img src="https://requiemvaccaro.github.io/post-images/1759931940784.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p><strong>Great name!</strong></p>
<p>Jacob: Yeah, and they were really great.</p>
<p>Pete: I seem to remember them saying they released two singles that evening.</p>
<p>Jacob: They’re cool, and they’re a great live band. They’re one of those bands that reminds you like shit, music is supposed to be fun. You can tell they’re having so much fun up there and it really rubs off on the audience.</p>
<p><strong>It always feels so good when you see a band with so much more energy than what can be felt on the recording.</strong></p>
<p>Jacob: It’s totally a step up.</p>
<p><strong>And looking into the rest of the summer and the year, is there anything you’re particularly excited about?</strong></p>
<p>All: Glastonbury!</p>
<p>Jamie: We’re playing with Sam at St. James’ Park, biggest venue we’ve ever played.</p>
<p>Pete: And we’re playing O2 Kentish Town Forum at the end of the year. We’ve seen a lot of gigs there so it’s going to be pretty surreal to play there.</p>
<p>Jamie: These are the biggest shows we’ve played in the UK so far.</p>
<p><strong>Congrats, it’s going to be great. Excited to get the new stuff out there?</strong></p>
<p>Jacob: Oh yeah, we’re not gonna waste any time!</p>

<p>“I think we just wanted to make a record like the ones we love.”</p>
<p>Jamie Staples, drummer in the solo project turned band, shares just how Wunderhorse went from Cub finding its feet to beast with eight legs and a thirst for the good old days of grunge.</p>
<p>Midas represents the second album under the moniker of Wunderhorse although, as Staples cements, “I think for us it would probably be an exception really as far as second albums go ‘cause I think we as a unit felt like it was our first.” After touring extensively together since the release of Cub in 2022, (a solo endeavour from lead Jacob Slater) the group returned to the studio like a couple fresh from their first trip abroad – newly official with copious amounts of shared material.</p>
<p>“Jacob was still the prime songwriter for this record… he’d bring things to us in an embryonic stage if you like, in a way that we could all build upon and put our stamp on, as players and as people,” Staples credits, going on to say, “our shared experiences together as friends and as bandmates I think contributed to us making something great.” The air of this record is undeniably collaborative, even the silence between songs feels like four held breaths and sets of poised fingertips. Cub may have been a beautiful collection of songs, but this new release is an album, living and breathing. “I think we knew that’s what we wanted to do, we wanted to make a live sounding record like you’re in the room with us when you listen to it,” he continues, the sun bleaching one side of his face. It’s hard not to smile at the irony of this image, that familiar stain of Midas gold following him like the world’s most lucrative ad campaign.</p>
<p>The album’s sound skips fly on the wall and jumps straight to stowaway in their kickdrum. If the goal was to make you feel like you’re there watching them rehearse, I’d say what they’ve achieved is one better – it’s more like you’re in the middle of the room feeding instruments through your bones and into a cassette. It’s not just live, it’s alive. “There’s obviously other records that we were able to reference to do that…” Staples chews on this thought not wishing to make any hasty comparisons, “I suppose most obviously In Utero which was recorded at the very same studio.”</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense that the ghost of great records past would lurk around the creation of Midas. After all, it represents the kind of controlled chaos that far too many artists now hide beneath the gloss of autotune and compressors. That’s not to say that the group didn’t employ any tools to give it that shiny coat, “there was a couple of Albini’s little tricks that we picked up.” Staples once again disclaimers that, “we didn’t want to make a second In Utero,” before divulging what golden tip the magpies took, “[you’d have] doors open in the studio, and you’d have amps in different rooms and they’d be cordoned off but we’d let it all bleed into the main room where the drums were.” Before you know it, every bit of air you can breathe is humming the same tune. It might not be In Utero, but it doesn’t need to be. It’s like stepping into the skin of a sound we’ve heard before and realising it still fits, it might even be more comfortable now.</p>
<p>The unspoken heartbeat beneath that skin of course being the drums. A cigarette dangles loosely from Staples fingertips as he muses, I’m sure unbiasedly, “I think a lot of coming to pick a studio space is about getting a great room for the drums… definitely an unsung hero – or at least I would say.” The drums are in many ways the spine of a live show, they kick in first and keep the whole track standing. On an album where “every take of every song [was a] live take,” they’re practically invaluable. “The drum sound I think is, on a record, one of the most important things to making it quite unique,” he finalises. In that way, Midas strikes gold as the drums aren’t just the beat, but another voice that weaves between lines like a bandit with a pulse.</p>
<p>As well as acknowledging the worth of his own role, Staples is also quick to praise his bandmates, Harry Fowler (guitar), Pete Woodin (bass) and Jacob Slater (vocals and guitar.) A smile plays on his cheeks as he states, “Jacob is very good at what he does.” Whilst Staples is keen to assure that everyone’s input is not just welcome but crucial, he also adds that, “more often than not,” they get behind whatever vision Slater is selling.</p>
<p>As a lyricist, Slater is unshakeable. His ability to lay out his soul with the words he writes whilst still saving space for yours to fit beside him makes for a record that isn’t just born from real emotion but buries in its listeners to tug that same emotion out of them. Wunderhorse may have started as just one person, but it was always destined to reach far beyond the body that built it. “I think, just speaking for myself, that’s one of the best things a songwriter can do actually… you know there’s obviously a personal element of their experience going into the song but to be able to write something that people in different situations can connect with is important,” Staples affirms, a ring glinting unassumingly on his left hand – etched on its face, the Wunderhorse insignia. “The real beauty is people taking what they need from it.”</p>
<p>The best records are nothing if not a bit of give and take. In a climate where newness is a rarity, it’s all about the art of reinvention. Midas collages sound from the grunge aesthetic of the 90s back to the rough surface of The Rolling Stones early releases. “It’s funny you mentioned The Stones because we would most mornings have a listening party, there was quite a selection of records at the studio… each morning we would put on a record and try and listen to it start to finish and there was a couple Stones records in there and Rubber Soul by The Beatles,” Staples explains how the past and present came together much like a paintbrush full of ink deployed in fresh water.</p>
<p>It would seem Wunderhorse’s reigns are more tightly held by artists of the past where attitude and imperfections ran free. “I think all of us liked more old music than new for sure, not that there isn’t some good stuff coming out, because there is, but it’s just an incredibly saturated thing now… I feel there is a lot going on,” he responds to the suggestion of their musical DNA being that of an old soul, “the essence of bands like Nirvana if you like and The Stones, there’s this freedom to it and it’s kind of at the core of what we love about music.”</p>
<p>Despite all the saturated colours of todays musical landscape, guitar-based sounds seem to be the brightest hue once again. Perhaps people are starting to crave the very freedom Staples described. With artists like Sam Fender and Fontaines DC on the tip of every critic’s tongue (both of whom Wunderhorse have recently supported), it’d be hard to argue that authenticity and experimentation aren’t once again being rewarded. “I think again just from our point of view, certainly in the recording of records, things have gotten maybe too considered and less raw and you end up with something quite polished but with… maybe less personality,” Staples rolls carefully over the end of his thought. What people seem to be demanding from their music now is simple: something fierce and something real. As Staples put it, “every now and then music comes along that is just undeniable, no matter what genre it’s in.”</p>
<p>How does that happen? You create to serve a song and not to serve an audience – or even to serve yourself. For Wunderhorse, that means creating, “even if you have to take a backseat or whatever it might be to create a world, to create an emotion, to allow the lyric to breathe… that’s what we all enjoy doing in the band anyway.”</p>
<p>Staples’ parting words drip with cheek and charm. Laughing as he considers how to sign off, he settles on, “just buy our records and come to our shows… so we can get paid!” In other words, feed the beast – Wunderhorse are undeniable.</p>

<p>Wunderhorse has shared a new single called ‘Leader of the Pack’.</p>
<p>Jacob Slater and his band are fast becoming one of the must-see live acsts of 2022, having already racked up support slots with Sam Fender, Foals and Fontaines D.C in recent weeks/ Meanwhile, his three-night residency at Soho’s Third Man Records sold out almost instantly.</p>
<p>Already a firm live favourite among fans, ‘Leader of the Pack’ signals Slater’s unshakeable ambition. All scuzzy, bluesy guitars and rich, snarling vocals, it’s a formidable offering which is born of betrayal, frustration and a desire to come out on top. It certainly justifies all the hype.</p>
<p>“Leader of the Pack is a song about betrayal,”Jacob says of the track. ‘About not being able to escape the thing that eats away at you, it’s a song written as a means of getting even.”</p>
<p>The song will feature on debut album ‘Cub’, which arrives on 16th September.</p>

<hr>
<p>Wunderhorse, aka the brilliant Jacob Slater, has shared a new single called ‘Butterflies’.</p>
<p>With each new single, Slater has immersed us in his unique sonic world – following his debut single ‘Teal’ with the spacious and hypnotic ’17’ and ‘Poppies’.</p>
<p>Reminiscent of Nirvana, ‘Butterflies’ is a dynamic and intense return – his melodic vocal delivered over tumbling layers of grunge-inspired guitars that gain intensity as the track progresses. Potent with emotion, there’s feelings of disenchantment that emanates from his biting lyrics.</p>
<p>As he puts it: ‘Butterflies’ is about a sexual experience I had with an older girl when I was still very young. I didn’t know what I was doing at all and it spun me out for a while.</p>
<p>I remember coming up with the main guitar riff, at that time it was the darkest sounding bit of music I’d written. The first set of lyrics didn’t really match the sinister nature of the music, so I decided to revisit an experience that made me feel uneasy the same way the music did.”</p>
<p>Wunderhourse has a two-night residency confirmed at Jack White’s Third Man Records in Soho at the end of May.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Danny Boyle’s PISTOL series, in which Jacob plays Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook, is set to air on Disney+ in spring.</p>

<p>With each impressive release, Wunderhorse (aka Jacob Slater) expands his sonic catalogue even further.</p>
<p>On ‘Teal’ we heard seething rock with heartland influences, while on ‘Poppy’ we were treated to some ambitiously widescreen fuzzy space-pop. Now the singer-songwriter is back with a heartfelt new single called ’17’.</p>
<p>Written at the age of seventeen, Jacob explains. “I remember coming back from a party and feeling a bit shit and the song just kind of fell out,”</p>
<p>‘It’s the oldest song I still play live and so I thought it deserved to get out there’.</p>
<p>Rich with melody and Americana influences, it’s another gripping slice of indie-rock that has us on firmly on side.</p>

<hr>
<p>After gaining widespread acclaim for his debut single ‘Teal’, Wunderhorse is back to show the breadth of his capabilities with the expansive ‘Poppy’.</p>
<p>A far cry from the riotous, feral punk we heard from his former band Dead Pretties, ‘Poppy’ indicates that Jacob Slater is no stranger to penning an arena-sized epic. Blending atmospheric shoegaze with melodic power pop, ‘Poppy’ is a wondrous thing that sees itself out with swirling psychedelia.</p>
<p>A huge statement from the newcomer, it indicates that Slater may just have a few more curveballs in his locker.</p>
<p>He says “Poppy is a song about a time and place long forgotten that suddenly returns to you in vivid recall, kind of like a dream that doesn’t belong to you anymore. I was listening to a lot of Jeff Buckley’s live album ‘Mystery White Boy’ when I wrote it, trying to work some of that kind of falsetto into it.”</p>
<p>Already displaying heaps of potential, Jacob also makes his acting debut playing Paul Cook in Danny Boyle’s forthcoming Sex Pistols biopic series, Pistol, via FX.</p>

<p>Musician — Newquay</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>原载于：Fred Perry
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>Name, where are you from?</strong><br>
Wunderhorse. I live in Newquay.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your style in three words?</strong><br>
Dad at festival.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best gig you’ve ever been to?</strong><br>
I saw the Meat Puppets play in some crappy venue in London a few years ago and they tore the f*cking roof off. Just a few old hairy dudes having the best time ever playing music. They hadn’t lost any of the youthful energy of kids playing in a garage and they certainly weren’t worried about looking cool or anything like that. It reminded me why I got into playing music in the first place. Thank you Meat Puppets. The version of 'Oh, Me' that they played that night made me feel like a big happy jellyfish.</p>
<p><strong>If you could be on the line up with any two artists in history?</strong><br>
Nick Drake. I’d have loved to be there at one of the very few shows he actually played. I love the song ‘Place To Be’ from the 'Pink Moon' record. Tom Waits. I love his music and I want to go fishing with him. It’s hard to pick one song of his but 'Burma-Shave' is a real masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>Which subcultures have influenced you?</strong><br>
I’ve never really been influenced by subcultures. I know that probably sounds like I’m trying to be edgy but honestly I think I’ve always been more drawn to individual people rather than movements.</p>
<p><strong>If you could spend an hour with anyone from history?</strong><br>
I’d like to go surfing for an hour with Miki Dora. Just to watch him do his thing really.</p>
<p><strong>Of all the venues you’ve been to or played, which is your favourite?</strong><br>
In my first band, we played in a friends bedroom at a house party in Bristol and there were about thirty people crammed into this tiny room and everybody was just going nuts. It was one of those teenage moments where you feel that what you are doing matters in some way. Whether it did or not isn’t really important, it felt good.</p>
<p><strong>Your greatest unsung hero or heroine in music?</strong><br>
Paul Kossoff. He was the guitarist for the band Free. He meant every f*cking note he ever played. His style was totally unique and there is a beautiful sense of space in his playing. Unfortunately, he died very young and was overshadowed by other guitarists of the day.</p>
<p><strong>The first track you played on repeat?</strong><br>
'The Real Me' by The Who.</p>
<p><strong>A song that defines the teenage you?</strong><br>
'Here Comes a Regular' by The Replacements.</p>
<p><strong>One record you would keep forever?</strong><br>
'Astral Weeks' by Van Morrison.</p>
<p><strong>A song lyric that has inspired you?</strong><br>
&quot;I’m a little teapot short and stout&quot;</p>
<p>From 'I'm A Little Teapot' by George Harold Sanders and Clarence Z. Kelley.</p>
<p><strong>The song that would get you straight on the dance floor?</strong><br>
I have yet to discover it.</p>
<p><strong>A song you wished you had written?</strong><br>
'After The Gold Rush' by Neil Young.</p>
<p><strong>Best song to turn up loud?</strong><br>
'The Laughing Gnome' by David Bowie.</p>
<p><strong>A song people wouldn’t expect you to like?</strong><br>
'Hymn Of The Cherubim' by Tchaikovsky.</p>
<p><strong>Best song to end an all-nighter on?</strong><br>
'Small Hours' by John Martyn.</p>

<p>“IF you’re not being a prolific artist then you’re wasting your time. Fuck the hype and get music out. If you can’t do that and you’re relying solely on hype then you shouldn’t be in the industry”</p>
<p>DEAD PRETTIES don’t care about the hype. One of the most talked-about underground bands in London, the three-piece have been lauded for bringing the city’s music scene back to life with a series of seismic live shows and gripping punk rock tunes.</p>
<p>A thrilling product of the same burgeoning punk rock scene that has produced the likes of Shame, Goat Girl and HMLTD, the young outfit want to let their music do the talking; and boy, do they have something to say. After railing against modern day apathy in truly thunderous fashion on their fuzz-laden debut single ‘Social Experiment’, they followed it up with an equally visceral new track a couple of weeks ago, appropriately titled ‘Confidence’. No bells and whistles required; Dead Pretties deal in ruthless rock &amp; roll.</p>
<p>Known to unleash savage chaos wherever they turn, the band are a vital addition to the bill at this year’s Tenement Trail. Raw, unfiltered and utterly relentless, you simply don’t want to miss these guys when they return to Glasgow on Saturday 30th September. And after speaking exclusively to TTV ahead of the big event, it’s clear that the three-piece are ready to make an incendiary impact.</p>
<p>“We’ve played in Glasgow a couple of times and we were very well received. There’s quite a lot of camaraderie in Scottish crowds, I don’t think they’re so concerned like they are in London about being cool. They just want to have a good time which is good as we can provide that”</p>
<p>Recalling previous outings on Sauchiehall St, particularly at Broadcast, the band’s fierce reputation has gathered momentum thanks to a number of memorable shows around the country in recent months. When asked what fans can expect from their highly anticipated show at Tenement Trail, drummer Ben Firth replies in deadpan fashion “For us to get a bill at the end of it”. He adds: “We don’t have a predictable way of playing shows. That might sound a bit up our own arse but whatever happens, happens. If the crowd are lively we’ll be lively…we sort of just bounce off them. If there’s five people there we’ll still go nuts… it’ll be better if there’s more than that though”.</p>
<p>While they describe the infamous Brixton Windmill as their favourite haunt, they are quick to note their growing affinity with northern crowds: “We seem to be well received up north which has exceeded our expectations.” Their craziest show to date though? “We played a gig at a place called The George Tavern. I don’t know what happened but the sound was shit, Oscar went through about three basses. He caught a candle on stage… and that’s just the beginning. It ended up with the three of us having a massive, quite bloody, fist fight on stage and I jumped off stage breaking my guitar and my nose. Someone in the crowd got whacked by Oscar’s bass, not intentionally though… and it all ended up pretty bloody.”</p>
<p>It’s an eye-opening, if not startling, insight into the kind of unpredictable chaos that follows Dead Pretties wherever they go; a band who pull no punches but have a hell of a lot of fun along the way. It’s immediately clear that the live environment is where they thrive. While ‘Social Experiment’ and ‘Confidence’ capture their infectious onstage energy in spades, Firth is keen to note that the live show is where they really come to life: “ I like to think we’re even more explosive in our live shows than we are on the record. If you listen to the record you’ll get one flavour and if you come see us live it’ll be more intense.”</p>
<p>Such has been the growth of interest surrounding the band this year, it comes as no surprise that they have played a number of festivals in recent months ahead of their return to Scotland. As the UK’s ever expanding festival scene continues to flourish, there are more and more opportunities like Tenement Trail for emerging artists to make an impression; and it’s a chance they don’t take lightly: “I think all these festivals give bands an opportunity to perform in front of a fresh crowd. There’s always something very exciting about getting the chance to do that and to get a platform as people will buy into the name of the festival. It’s something you can get your teeth into and that’s communicating the thoughts of the younger generation. You can come along and see loads of cool bands and it’s up to the bands to get the finger out and try and impress which is what we always try and do.”</p>
<p>Behind all the chaotic fun and live ruckus though, Dead Pretties instil their deviant rock &amp; roll with a sharp social commentary. They’re a band with something to say but they do so with a refreshing vitality and piercing perspective, all without taking themselves too seriously; they’re guitar heroes in waiting for the younger generation who have grasped onto this fledgling scene they’ve unconsciously become a part of. With that in mind, discussion moves to their most recent single ‘Confidence’; a raucous punk rock thrill ride that sums the band up over the course of its three minutes. Firth discusses its inspiration:</p>
<p>“It’s about looking at the way the media portray trivial figures and make a big meal out of what they do. Focus public’s eye on that when they could be reporting on things that have much more significance especially given the current political climate. The whole idea that you don’t need to be good at anything or have anything important to say anymore.. that you can use stupidity as one your assets to sell yourself to the masses and that’s something we fundamentally disagree with. And I’d like to see them all shot….in the same way you put a violent dog down, just take them out of existence”</p>
<p>Like many artists at the moment, the three-piece have been inspired by the state of the world around them and the blinding apathy that plagues modern society; and they’re not afraid to hold back. However, creative expression must come arm in arm with authenticity and that’s what lies at the very heart of what they do: “I don’t think it’s a requirement but if you feel compelled to comment on something then you should and you shouldn’t be afraid of that. But you shouldn’t have to cause then you’re limiting yourself to one thing. If you want to write love songs then do it. Do whatever comes naturally and inspires you cause otherwise you’re playing someone else’s game and you’re not being authentic.”</p>
<p>Bold, ambitious and utterly fearless, they’re a band determined to cut their own path. Completely unwilling to get wrapped up in any form of hype, it’s clear that there’s elements of the music industry that they’re not at ease with; but at the same time, they are brilliantly entertaining and compelling to listen to. For example, Firth is slightly reluctant to talk of the coveted scene that they’re seemingly part of in around South London as mentioned earlier. Any competition is healthy though in their eyes.</p>
<p>“We’re spurred on by those around us. They’re all nice people and we all make different music. Thank god someone somewhere has called it a scene as it’s given everyone loads of attention and a platform from which to boost ourselves from. I don’t know if it’s a scene or not, that’s for you guys to say. That’s fine and I’m not knocking it. If there wasn’t that media focus, lots of bands wouldn’t be doing it aswell. The truth of it is we need journalists to boost us and our reputation. It’s a platform so thank god someone has been commenting on something worth commenting on rather than what I was talking about earlier about stupid trivial things.”</p>
<p>Dead Pretties are the future and it’s time to get on board at start of what is sure to be a hugely compelling journey. Firth concludes: “We plan to be on the road all time, non-stop gigging is our strong suit. An album will be coming out soon if I have anything to do with it. We aren’t going to be lying around doing nothing and basking in our very limited glory. Onwards and upwards or sideways whatever way it’s going to go.”</p>
