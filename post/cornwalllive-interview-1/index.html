<p>Newquay's Jacob Slater has celebrity fans in Sam Fender and Fontaines DC, and played a Sex Pistol on TV</p>

<hr>
<p>Jacob Slater has been tipped as the next Sam Fender, has had his band's debut album mentioned as one of the best of 2022 and is currently on a UK tour supporting Irish wonders Fontaines DC. Not bad for a bloke who was teaching surfing in Newquay until recently.</p>
<p>Jacob fronts and is the songwriter for Wunderhorse, whose album Cub is a brilliant catalogue of teenage life - ill-fated love, drugs, self-destruction, depression as well as youthful joy - all to a rousing soundtrack that harks back to the 1990s, with touches of Nirvana, Elliott Smith, Radiohead, Jeff Buckley and, on the epic Poppy, Stone Roses at their most majestic. It is a thing of wonder.</p>
<p>After a teenage Jacob - now 24 - called it a day on fronting the much-hyped but ultimately unsuccessful punk outfit Dead Pretties in 2017, he moved to Cornwall to take care of himself, indulge in his passion for surfing and live a less chaotic life. The clean coastal air and slower pace of life quickly paid dividends, allowing Jacob to grow as an artist and apply himself to building an introspective and thoughtful songbook, without losing any of the bite from his previous endeavour.</p>
<p>Speaking to CornwallLive from the band's tour bus en route to a gig in Glasgow, Jacob said: &quot;I still live in Cornwall but I'm basically never there. It's a real shame - I love touring but I also love surfing and I love my mates down there. It's a real blessing to be doing what I'm doing at the moment, so I guess it's part and parcel that you're always going to miss home.&quot;</p>
<p>The band will be ramping up their burgeoning success with a huge UK tour next year, which includes two dates in Cornwall, which means at least he'll get back home to Newquay for a few days in 2023. Wunderhorse also support Pixies on their European tour in February and March.</p>
<p>&quot;I started going down to Newquay when I was about nine years old. A guy called Matthew taught me to surf and I fell in love with the place and always wanted to live down there. About three and a half years ago I moved down permanently, but then all this kicked off so I'm not there that much at the moment.&quot;</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://requiemvaccaro.github.io/post-images/1768481209055.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Jacob added: &quot;It was a safe haven and sanctuary when the Dead Pretties folded and still is totally. There's space and time to think in Cornwall. Being in London, it feels like the whole place is eating you alive - you can breathe a bit easier in Cornwall.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that some of the songs on Cub were written during the changeover period from London to Cornwall, but a batch of new songs are much more of a band effort. &quot;That record's just come out, but for me those songs are really old now. Lots of the stuff that will be on the next record will be songs that have been written on the road or in Cornwall.</p>
<p>&quot;I was lucky in that I met the rest of the guys in the band when I was living in London, before I moved to Cornwall. I spent five years living in London - I served my time. Each to their own, it's just not for me. When I came down to Cornwall I was actually teaching surfing - that's how I got on my feet and was paying the rent for a season, then I got really lucky and got this acting job.&quot;</p>
<p>That acting job was playing Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook in Danny Boyle's acclaimed 2022 TV series, Pistol.</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="https://requiemvaccaro.github.io/post-images/1768481417953.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>He explained: &quot;Someone I knew from the music world reached out to say they were holding auditions and they thought I was the right age and look, and they were looking for musicians. I thought I'd give it a go, not expecting anything, and struck it super lucky.&quot;</p>
<p>People wrote off the series before it was even screened - including Johnny Rotten himself - but when it was aired it received glowing reviews. &quot;Everyone knew that would happen. If you're going to make a show about the Sex Pistols there's going to be a load of true fans going 'it's f<em><strong>ing s</strong></em>'. But it's really good and it was a lot of fun making it.&quot;</p>
<p>Jacob is seen on the show wearing Vivienne Westwood's infamous and controversial Cambridge Rapist T-shirt, which was often worn by the Pistols at the height of their infamy.</p>
<p>&quot;We were filming in Peckham Rye and I was walking down the road to get some cigarettes, and I was in costume, wearing that T-shirt. I was strolling to the shops and I was wondering why everyone was looking at me so weird. On my way back I suddenly realised emblazoned on the front of me were the words 'Cambridge Rapist' and so I started running back to the set, which probably made me look even more suspicious.&quot;</p>
<p>Conor Deegan, from Fontaines DC, made Cub his favourite album of the year in the new issue of Mojo magazine, saying: &quot;The act that really wowed me this year is Wunderhorse. We took them on tour to America and I got to watch them a lot. They're a great band, probably better than us. They brought it every night consistently.&quot;</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="3"><img src="https://requiemvaccaro.github.io/post-images/1768481504596.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Jacob was not aware of the glowing recommendation and told the rest of the band, while I was on the phone to him: &quot;Wahey, good on him. That's news to us. I knew Grian (Chatten, singer with Fontaines DC) before everything started. He and a couple of the other members of the band came down to one of our shows at the Lexington and made it known they were fans of our music. We went to the States with them and now we're doing this tour with them. We're very happy to be part of their journey.</p>
<p>&quot;We're all glad that the album's been received well and getting some respect from the right kind of people. We do feel we're on the cusp of something but more within ourselves. We're really excited to see the promotion of this record through and then get the next one going. We all feel that we have so much more to offer musically.&quot;</p>
<p>I mentioned some of the artists Cub reminds me of and Jacob said they're all musicians he loves: &quot;There was a period when all me and my friend Harry, who's in the band, listened to was Jeff Buckley. These days, I'm much more into an Elliott Smith kind of vibe, some of the phrasing is very much inspired by him.&quot;</p>
<p>What about the epic Stone Roses-sounding ending to the song, Poppy? &quot;That's exactly what we were trying to do - how can we make the ending sound like I Am The Resurrection, that big jam session? I feel that people don't jam that much nowadays on album tracks and that celebration of how much fun music can be when you're all going hammer and tongs at it.&quot;</p>
<p>What does Jacob make of people saying he's the new Sam Fender, who Wunderhorse have also supported?</p>
<p>&quot;We know Sam and he's a lovely guy. It's cool to be compared to someone who's doing really well for themselves,&quot; he said. &quot;Personally, I think we sound quite different to him. I guess it's an obvious comparison to make as we both make uptempo guitar music - Sam's got his own thing going but so do we. It's nice to be compared, but we're definitely separate entities.&quot;</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="4"><img src="https://requiemvaccaro.github.io/post-images/1768481569169.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Jacob told me: &quot;Playing in Newquay and Falmouth next year will be a blessing. Our tour manager helped build the inside of the Cornish Bank, so it will be good to play there.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to try to get a week or maybe two back in Newquay before Christmas. Next year's going to be so busy that I've managed to get a few weeks surfing in Morocco with my mate Matty, so that's going to be my holiday and then it will be straight back into gigging next year, which is full on to the end of the year. Recording the next album is on the cards too.&quot;</p>
